The half dome cables are taken down every fall at the end of the season.
The trick is, the cables don't go away completely.
They're actually left hanging on the face of the rock; only the supports that turn the cables into hand rails and wooden footholds are removed.

With a little bit of climbing gear -- harnesses, carabiners, and prusik loops -- it's totally possible to climb half dome with the cables down.

That's exactly what we did at the end of October!
We camped overnight for one night at the backpacker's camp in little Yosemite valley to break up the climb up, then summitted the mountain, climbed down, and drove home the next day.
It was an unforgettable experience!

## Permits

Normally, during the summer, there are lotteries for half dome permits (and wilderness permits, if breaking up the climb and camping overnight).

However, after the cables come down at the end of the season, you don't need any permits to climb half dome!
You only need a wilderness permit if you're camping overnight, and those are walk-up only; reservations not required nor possible.
For us, the wilderness permit was by self-registration (perhaps because it was a weekday) so we had no issues obtaining that.

## Camping

At night it was freezing.
I wasn't sure if I would be warm enough with my gear, because this was my first time trying it in such low temperatures.
My sleeping quilt is rated for 30 deg, my foam sleeping pad is pretty minimal, but I did have warm fleece layers to sleep in.
I was only half-asleep for most of the night because I shift around a lot in my sleep, and anything that shifted too far away from my ground pad or sleeping quilt would get too cold.
I woke up with frozen condensation inside my test.

Despite that, this was one of my favorite camping experiences.
The little Yosemite valley backpacker's campsite is nestled peacefully in the woods under the shadow of half dome.
And fires are permitted in the communal fire rings.
Together with strangers from all over the world, we gathered closely around a warm fire on a cold dark night to stay warm and swap stories.

I know I carry way too much water. I sweat a lot, and I just like to drink a lot of water!

I also took too much food -- we weren't sure if we'd be staying an extra night or not, so I brought a few extra meals worth of food with me that I didn't end up eating.
There are bear boxes in the trail head parking lot, so I should have left my extra rations there...
